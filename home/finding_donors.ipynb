    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "4. Healthcare : Analyzing a group of over million people for myocardial infarction within a period of 10 years is an application area of logistic regression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Strengths-\n",
    "       \n",
    "1. It is easy to understand and interpret.\n",
    "       \n",
    "2. It is very easy to train the model and takes very little time.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "Weaknesses-\n",
    "       \n",
    "1. It changes its behavior drastically when the training data has outliers.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. This model has no concept of error.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. They tend to overfit if the input labels are highly correlated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Advantages in using this model for Finding Donors CharityML problem-\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. All census data conform to a particular pattern and such patterns can be easily classified. Hence, the logistic regression model can perform very well given that it is a statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It doesn't take much time to train the model even for very large datasets which is becomes an issue if there is a time constraint placed on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. AdaBoost:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Real-World Applications-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AdaBoost Classifier is used in Haar image classifiers for facial recognition technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They are used in commercial softwares to detect select objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is widely used in the medicine field to detect and analyse X-ray images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths-    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When used in conjunction with Decision Tree qualifiers, the information gained at each stage is used to feed input to complex-tree growing algorithms which is useful in solving more hard problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A very strong learner can be obtained from base weak learners and this is useful in the sense that the weak learners can be tweaked to reduce the classification error and hence, this model is very extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is less susceptible to overfitting than other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimal solution not guranteed always.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages in using this model for Finding Donors CharityML probelm-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since it is not okay to have classification errors, we need to have some penalty for the misclassified points. AdaBoost provides this and therefore can give very accurate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It requires less no. of iterations to solve the classification problem because it requires less no. of parameters to tweak. This is suitable in this case because we have a lot of features here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Real-World Applications -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Boosting is widely used in page-ranking algorithms of major web commercial giants like Yahoo and Yandex.\n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It naturally handles data of mixed type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It's predictions are very accurate because of its robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using loss functions and finding its derivatives, we can optimise the model and reduce the error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It gives a lot of room to tune its paramters according to our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using regulariztion, we can impose restrictions to reduce high variance to fit the model well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is very sensitive to feature scaling. Because of the serial nature of boosting, it hardly can be serialised, resulting in long training periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages in using this model for Finding Donors CharityML probelm-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The accuracy of the model never wavers even in the presence of maligned data. Since a census may never be accurate because of issues like human error, it is highly adaptible to outliers and does not affect the overall model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Usually all census data follow a pattern. This dataset will be no different. Hence, it will be better if we find a proper error function that has nice derivatives then we can develop a model with high accuracy but also bounds the probelm with linear constraints. This makes it simple yet efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This model is highly customisable. We can add regularizations, penalties to reduce the no. of misclassified points, and also have a balanced tree structure by mentioning constraints like \"max-depth\", \"min-samples-per-node\" etc. This helps us to reduce high-variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The Gradient Boosting Classifier has secured the highest F-Score amongst the chosen algorithms on testing when 100% of the given training data was used to train the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient Boosting 86.3% accuracy on the testing set after we have used the full training set. Also we can notice that there is a pattern in the accuracy rate as well with respect to the size of training set used. As the training set increases in size, the accuracy attribute also has risen accordingly. This is an another factor that indicates the fact that the model is becoming more and more accurate when we use large training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model takes about 11.2s to successfully train and about 0.025s to make a well-educated prediction.  This clearly indicates that the intelligence of this classifeir increases when we train it more. That is in plain terms, it gets smarter as we train it harder. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As expected, the training time required increases as the size of the dataset increases. But comparatively, the Gradient Boosting classifier takes much more time to train. From the graph, we can see that the AdaBoost classifier has taken only 1.93s to complete its training whereas the Gradient Boosting needed 11s to do so. This is large training time is only due to the iterative manner in which the algorithm uses its weaak learners to build a string learner.But there is one interesting thing though. Gradient Boosting has surpassed AdaBoost in predicting values quickly. AdaBoost has taken 0.93s whereas Gradient Boosting has managed to do it in 0.025s. This clearly indicates the quality of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm's Suitability for the Data- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Admittedly this model takes much longer to train with respect to others. But in our given problem statement, there is no need for a hard deadline. A time constraint isn't necessary in this case. So we can accept a reasonable training time anywhere in the span of seconds. Finding donors can be done at any given momemnt using the software and there is no strict schedule. Therefore, this quality of the problem at hand reinforces the suitability of the chosen algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since errors are intolerable in this classification problem, we can add appropriate error functions and regularizations to penalise the model for misclassification of points. This way the model tends to give correct predictions most of the time.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is a Classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifier is an algorithm, a technicque that takes a bunch of data and learn from the data and make predictions about the class of a new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an algorithm that uses different classifiers to build a more stronger one. The original algorthms are called weak learners and the resultant combined one is called a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is an algorithm that uses different weights for different weak learners based on their accuracies to combine them into one strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Gradient Boosting work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes a sample of the training dataset and tests to see how accurate each learner is. We find the best learner. In addition, samples that are misclassified are given a heavier weight, so that they have a higher chance of being picked in the next round. Then, the best learner is also given a weight depending on its accuracy and incorporated into the ensemble of learners. There is only one learner at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting again attempts to look for the best learner. The sample of patient training data is now influenced by the more heavily misclassified weights. In other words, previously misclassified patients have a higher chance of showing up in the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the explanation -\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like getting to the second level of a video game and not having to start all over again when your character is killed. Instead, you start at level 2 and focus all your efforts on getting to level 3.\n",
    "Likewise, the first learner likely classified some patients correctly. Instead of trying to classify them again, let’s focus all the efforts on getting the misclassified patients. The best learner is again weighted and incorporated into the ensemble, misclassified patients are weighted so they have a higher chance of being picked and we rinse and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### After N rounds: \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re left with an ensemble of weighted learners trained and then repeatedly retrained on misclassified data from the previous rounds. This model is now expected to be highly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting Analogy - \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a group of superheroes, Mr.Brainy McCoy, The Flash, Superman. Suppose they are asked to fight a villainous, an invincible monster. To defeat the monster we need lightning speed, superhuman power, and a high level of intelligence. The monster can't be defeated individually by any of the superheros. But the combined together they may have a chance. So now, we will see how Gradient Boosting works. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Gradient Boosting sees which superhero is the strongest, most likely to defeat the enemy. It chooses Mr.Brainy McCoy. After all, intelligence is the most powerful weapon in any armory. But the monster defeats him. He was completely outpowered even though he has great strategies. So he needs someone who had extraordinary power.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Now Gradient Boosting, sees that McCoy needs more firepower. So it chooses the strongest superhero from the available ones. It chooses Superman. Now, Superman and McCoy together fight the enemy. But, oh, the monster just got away in the nick of time. It seems that we need someone who is superfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.In the next stage, Gradient Boosting clearly understands that the superheroes need some speed. So it approaches the Flash and asks for his help. Flash agrees and he joins the superheroes. They fight the enemy and this time, yay, they win and put the monster back in jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Explanation-\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the above answer can be easily arrived at after a moment's thought. To have a good business or career, one must be highly educated. Education provides a person with all the facilities to pursue a career in any field. There are however exceptions if a person gets into a field without any prior experience and still succeed. This happens in family businesses. So logically, the next deciding factor of a person's wealth status is his/her age. Because not all persons in the age spectrum have an income in 5 digits. Examples include students, children, toddlers etc can't be expected to have that sort of money. Only busines persons who have been in their respective fields for some considerable amount of time could possibly be wealthy. This shows that age is definintely a factor. Next we can look at the person's profession. It's only common sense that we include profession in this list. Profesions like business, sports, actors, bankers will surely have a good financial background. Also we can tell that people with regular day-jobs will not be enthusiastic in donating fifty grand. Hence, profession is a necessary field to determine a peron's financial ability. Next in line comes the capital-loss and capital-gain features. They are both equally indicative of a person's financial status. The fact that a person has a good capital-gain clearly tells that he currently has a good career and he is expected to attain higher levels of financial status and will probably be a philanthropist in the future. Similarly, capital-loss feature tells how badly a person is running his business which makes it easier for a classifier to decide if that person is capable of donating fifty grand or more. The above discussion sure does have some exceptions in each field but their numbers are very low and hence can be safely excluded out of our rationale.\n"

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1.By using the above technicque it is seen that the five features that are important to make a decision are education, age, marital-status, capital-loss or gain in decreasing order of importance.\n",
    "The features that I guessed were almost the same as the calculated ones except for the marital status feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.As I guessed, education was the most important feature of all and it is what that has weighed the largest in the model as shown in the graph. The age factor was also accounted for in my prediction and it has come second in the important feature list. Age is a decisive factor because most succesful people are middle-aged with a very good educational background. My idea that capital-loss and capital-gain were also required to make a well-informed decision was confirmed by the above visualisation. The fact that a person has a appreciable value in those two features indicate that the person is certainly employed in a business that is currently active.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.However, the only thing that I apparently missed out on is the importance of the marital-status feature specifcally the one that tells if that person is a spouse or not. Now that I think about it, I realise that marital status does indicate in a way if a person has a decent income or not. A person should be able to provide for his family and therfore he or she should have some security for their future and this they cannot have if they are not having some form of living with a decent pay. A well settled person with a family to take care of and who is expected to look after the children and spend for their expenses will not be a cheap task. Such a person cannot be unemployed or financially deficit. In that manner, the marital status feature that indicates whether a person is married and is a spouse is an important feature to consider in predicting a person's income. A family man should have a decent income. Hence, chances are that he/she has a good income."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1.The final model's F-score and accuracy score have droppped a little bit. This is a direct consequence of the limited no. of input variables available for the model to predict the output variable. When trained with full features, the model has performed really well with a bit more accuracy and precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a catch. This model which was trained only using 5 features has significantly reduced training time of 6s whereas it took 11s to train the model with the full feature set. This enables us to train even more large datasets in a small peroid of time. This helps us to make our model even smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.If training time was indeed a factor, then, yes, I would use the reduced data set for training my model. Because from what I gather a small decrease in accuracy (1.4%) is a modest trade off for very small training time. Very small training time is beneficial in the longer run. When especially, we need to train a large no. of models on very large datasets with very limited resources. Under that constraint, a slighlty less accurate model is far more better than no model at all. Moreover we can make up for that dip in accuracy by using cross-validation for the model evaluation.\n",
